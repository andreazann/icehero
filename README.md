# Ice Hero Game Information

This Lua files are meant to run on Corona SDK.
Unfortunately a lot of the APIs that I was using 8 years ago are now deprecated so this project could not run on an updated SDK :(

The files uploaded until now are just a small portion of what the game is and are actually in the first stages of what has been the game development in 2010. I'm planning on recollect all the source code and try to comment all of it since when I programmed those files at 14 I still wasn't commenting my code.
